This script is designed to perform real-time depth estimation using a webcam. It utilizes OpenCV for capturing video frames and the MiDaS model from PyTorch for computing depth information from these frames. The script processes the video feed in real time, displaying both the original camera feed and a depth map, which represents the estimated depth for each part of the image.

Key features of the script include:

    Initialization: It starts by setting up the MiDaS model for depth estimation and OpenCV for video capture.

    Real-Time Video Processing: The script continuously captures frames from the webcam, processes them, and applies the depth estimation model to each frame.

    Depth Visualization: The estimated depth is visualized using a color map, making it easier to interpret.

    Interactive Controls: Users can interact with the script using keyboard commands to save images or change the color map of the depth visualization.

    Performance Monitoring: It calculates and displays the frame rate (FPS) to monitor the performance of the depth estimation in real time.

This script is useful for applications that require an understanding of the depth information in a scene, such as in robotics, augmented reality, or even for general research purposes in computer vision.
